# W&B Training Monitoring

W&B tracking is optional and disabled by default. Each algorithm is recorded as
one W&B run, while all algorithms launched by one comparison command share a
group so their curves can be compared directly.

The online mode transmits experiment configuration, episode metrics, and W&B
system telemetry. This integration does not upload the dataset, images,
checkpoints, or source code (`save_code=False`).

## Install on Windows

From the project environment:

```powershell
pip install -r requirements-wandb.txt
wandb login
```

Alternatively, set `WANDB_API_KEY` in the Windows environment instead of
placing a key in source code. Never commit the API key.

## Live online monitoring

```powershell
python run_comparision.py `
  --topology-scenario medium_20d_6s `
  --episodes 3 `
  --baseline-episodes 1 `
  --graph-gat-device cuda `
  --wandb-mode online `
  --wandb-project industrial-task-offloading `
  --wandb-group medium-gpu-smoke-seed75 `
  --note medium-gpu-smoke
```

`--wandb-entity` is optional. Use it when the run belongs to a W&B team rather
than the account configured by `wandb login`.

## Offline monitoring

Use offline mode when the training machine cannot reach W&B reliably:

```powershell
python run_comparision.py `
  --topology-scenario large_30d_10s `
  --episodes 3 `
  --baseline-episodes 1 `
  --graph-gat-device cuda `
  --wandb-mode offline `
  --wandb-project industrial-task-offloading `
  --note large-gpu-smoke
```

Preserve the generated `wandb/` directory. It can be synchronized later from a
machine with Internet access using the `wandb sync` command printed by W&B.

## Logged metrics

One record is logged after every completed episode:

- reward, delay, and energy;
- local/edge action ratios and requested/resolved action counts;
- penalty count and simulated penalty time;
- simulated local, server, transfer, and queue/wait time under `simulation/*`;
- Graph-GAT graph-build, warmup, action-selection, PPO-update time, and rollout
  transition count;
- wall-clock DAG generation, priority inference, slot initialization, action
  collection, environment step, metric summary, rollout storage, model update,
  connection-window, joint-state, accounted, and unaccounted time;
- connection-window requests, actual updates, and sampled-point count;
- episode duration, elapsed time, progress percentage, and ETA;
- explicit CUDA allocated/reserved/peak memory for Graph-GAT, in addition to
  W&B system telemetry.

The project calls `run.log()` once per episode with an explicit episode step, so
metrics from the same episode stay aligned.

The legacy `execution/*` metrics remain for compatibility. They are simulated
system delays, not CPU profiler timings. Use `runtime/*` when investigating
training speed.

## Post-optimization CPU/CUDA validation

After synchronizing the environment connection-window update, launch these as
separate commands so the only intended difference is `--graph-gat-device`.
The `--algorithms` filter prevents the rest of the ablation matrix from running.

CPU:

```powershell
python run_comparision.py `
  --topology-scenario large_30d_10s `
  --episodes 20 `
  --baseline-episodes 1 `
  --algorithms "Graph-GAT MAPPO" `
  --graph-gat-device cpu `
  --wandb-mode online `
  --wandb-project industrial-task-offloading `
  --wandb-group env-repair-large-seed75 `
  --note env-repair-large-cpu-20ep
```

CUDA:

```powershell
python run_comparision.py `
  --topology-scenario large_30d_10s `
  --episodes 20 `
  --baseline-episodes 1 `
  --algorithms "Graph-GAT MAPPO" `
  --graph-gat-device cuda `
  --wandb-mode online `
  --wandb-project industrial-task-offloading `
  --wandb-group env-repair-large-seed75 `
  --note env-repair-large-cuda-20ep
```

Compare medians over episodes 2-20 for `training/episode_seconds`,
`runtime/env_step_seconds`, `runtime/connection_window_seconds`,
`runtime/action_collection_seconds`, `runtime/rollout_storage_seconds`, and
`runtime/model_update_seconds`.

## Graph-GAT 1000-episode tuning

Use `medium_20d_6s` as the tuning map. Keep `paper_10d_3s` and
`large_30d_10s` as transfer checks so hyperparameters are not selected on every
evaluation map independently.

First run the unchanged 1000-episode control:

```powershell
python run_comparision.py `
  --topology-scenario medium_20d_6s `
  --episodes 1000 `
  --algorithms "Mask-MAPPO" "Graph-GAT Warmup Mask MAPPO" `
  --graph-gat-device cuda `
  --wandb-mode online `
  --wandb-project industrial-task-offloading `
  --wandb-entity ObjectPromptDA `
  --wandb-group graph-gat-1000-control-medium-seed75 `
  --note graph-gat-1000-control-medium
```

Then run the first stability-oriented Graph-GAT candidate:

```powershell
python run_comparision.py `
  --topology-scenario medium_20d_6s `
  --episodes 1000 `
  --algorithms "Graph-GAT Warmup Mask MAPPO" `
  --graph-gat-device cuda `
  --graph-gat-lr 0.00008 `
  --graph-gat-encoder-lr 0.00003 `
  --graph-gat-clip-param 0.15 `
  --graph-gat-ppo-epochs 4 `
  --graph-gat-entropy-coef 0.005 `
  --graph-gat-value-loss-coef 0.5 `
  --graph-gat-max-grad-norm 0.5 `
  --graph-gat-warmup-episodes 20 `
  --graph-gat-warmup-updates-per-step 2 `
  --graph-gat-warmup-lr 0.0003 `
  --wandb-mode online `
  --wandb-project industrial-task-offloading `
  --wandb-entity ObjectPromptDA `
  --wandb-group graph-gat-1000-tuned-v1-medium-seed75 `
  --note graph-gat-1000-tuned-v1-medium
```

This candidate reduces encoder drift with a smaller encoder learning rate and
gradient clipping. It spreads roughly the same auxiliary-update budget over 20
episodes instead of concentrating it in the first five. Select it using the
mean and standard deviation of the final 100 episodes, not episode 1000 alone.
If it beats the control, reuse the exact same values on the paper and large
maps without per-map retuning.

## Disable tracking

No W&B installation or login is required in the default mode:

```powershell
python run_comparision.py --wandb-mode disabled
```
